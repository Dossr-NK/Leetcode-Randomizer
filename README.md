# Leetcode Randomizer
This fairly basic project is meant to just help me randomly get a leetcode question to do for the day. 
Currently it is set to only give me 1 question a day and depending on the day it will give me an easy or medium question. 
The leetcode practice repo with all my solutions is currently in the works as there is only 1 question and will remain private until there are more than a few questions.

This readme is also a work in progress and will (probably) be updated eventually.
